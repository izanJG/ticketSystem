  <h2>About this proyect ✨</h2>
  <h3>
    TicketSystem was a university project developed by a team of three people, and represented my first contact with tools like Git and Maven. During development we apply the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology, using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. 
    Additionally, we employ refactoring techniques such as Replace Temp with Query, Hide Method, and others to improve code clarity, maintainability, and efficiency.
